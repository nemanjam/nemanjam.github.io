## Overview

Job ads aggregator for the HackerNews "Who’s Hiring" threads with focus on fresh and recurring job opportunities.

## Goals

Evaluate the potential of the idea and the level of interest for a website of this type. Build MVP quickly.

## Tech stack

- Next.js, ShadcnUI, TailwindCSS
- SQLite, better-sqlite3
- Keyv, Keyv LRU, node-cron, Docker

## Features

- Group companies into 3 categories: 1. First time, 2. New, 3. Old
- Visualize data with graphs 
- Link and sort ads chronologically
- Search company posting history
- Automate parsing with cron jobs
- Improve performance with caching and server side rendering
- Deploy with Docker

## Implementation details

This is a Next.js server side rendered app with default ShadcnUI components. Algolia API is used as a data source because HackerNews webserver has a very strict scraping policy. Minimal relevant data is stored in SQLite database which is used for fast and precise queuing. The query results are cached with Keyv LRU in memory cache to improve performance. 

The app requires zero maintenance, the only insert query to parse a new month is automated using a `node-cron` scheduled task. The app is packed as a Docker image, either in Github Actions or locally, and is available for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms. It also has Winston logger and Plausible analytics.

## Lessons learned 

- Idea and project got most attention on HackerNews because the public is already profiled and familiar with "Who’s Hiring" threads.
- HackerNews is very strict with scraping their pages, best to use alternative data sources.
- Keyv cache instance is available only within the original Next.js app process, and `cache.clear()` call from the cron script that runs in a separate Node.js process does not have any effect. Solved by detecting database change and clearing cache in the original Next.js app. Cache that runs as a standalone process like Redis would also work.
- It is not possible to run cron in Docker as non-root user, so it is best to use Node.js or Go package for scheduling tasks inside Docker.
